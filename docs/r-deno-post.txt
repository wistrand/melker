Melker - Terminal UI framework with permission sandboxing (built on Deno)

I've been working on Melker, a terminal UI framework that treats apps as readable documents with explicit permission policies.

Website: https://melker.sh
GitHub: https://github.com/wistrand/melker
What it does

  - HTML-like markup for terminal UIs (<container>, <button>, <tabs>, <dialog>, etc.)
  - DevTools-like inspection of apps
  - Flexbox layout with CSS-like styling
  - Permission sandboxing via <policy> tags - apps declare what they need, users approve before running
  - Canvas graphics, video playback, Mermaid diagrams
  - Run apps from URLs with mandatory policy review
  - No build step - write markup, run immediately

Melker uses Deno's permission system (--allow-read, --allow-net, etc.) to enforce sandboxing. Apps run in subprocesses with only the permissions they declare. The runtime bundler uses Deno's APIs, and the whole thing is TypeScript-native.

Feedback welcome - especially on the permission model and DX.
