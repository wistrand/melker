Title: Show HN: Melker - Terminal UIs you can read before you run

URL: https://melker.sh

First comment:

Melker: Run text with meaning.

Melker is a Deno/TypeScript library and runtime for creating terminal UIs using an HTML-like document model. Apps are single .melker files with HTML-like syntax and embedded TypeScript.

The idea: TUI apps should be inspectable like web pages. Before running, the source and permissions are visible. No hidden network calls or file access.

Key features:

- Embedded permission policy (sandboxed subprocess)
- Run from URL with first-run approval
- F12 Dev Tools (view source, inspect document tree)
- Flexbox layout, 20+ components
- No build step, TypeScript runs directly

Motivation: Sharing TUI tools shouldn't require asking people to trust arbitrary code.

Requires Deno 2.5+.
