Title: Show HN: Melker - Terminal UIs you can read before you run

URL: https://melker.sh

First comment:


Melker is a Deno/TypeScript runtime and library for creating rich terminal UIs using an HTML-like document model.
Apps are single .melker files with XML-like syntax and embedded TypeScript.

The idea: TUI apps should be inspectable like web pages.
Before running, the source and permissions are visible. Network calls or file access must be declared.

Key features:

- Embedded permission policy (sandboxed subprocess)

- Run from URL with first-run approval

- F12 Dev Tools (view source, inspect document tree, logs, ...)

- Flexbox layout, 20+ components, including images and markdown viewer

- No build step, TypeScript runs directly

Motivation: Sharing TUI tools shouldn't require asking people to trust arbitrary code.
Also, I really wanted a typescript playground for graphical terminal apps.

Requires Deno 2.5+.
