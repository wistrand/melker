    Client->>Server: This is a very long message that should test how word wrapping works in the sequence diagram
    Server->>Database: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com' AND status = 'active' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100
    Database-->>Server: Returns a large result set containing user information including name, email, address, and preferences
    Server-->>Client: JSON response with paginated user data and metadata about the total count and available pages
